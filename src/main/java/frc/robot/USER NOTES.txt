joystick port 0

make sure telescope motor is id 10
make sure rotation motor is id 9
telescope motor might need to be reversed

pid stuff is labeled and can be changed in constants

A or B button toggles claw

left joystick can be set to a position like desmos graph shown before. i dont know if the limits work.
if it doesnt work, comment out line 37 in "RobotContainer.java" then use up down arrows.

i dont know if my constant "winch radius" is correct (it needs to be gear radius / gear ratio(27))

at 6:25 the build was successful.

BE CAREFUL WITH THE TELESCOPE STUFF, COULD BREAK SOMETHING

please either stop testing or review code one function at a time if something wrong happens.


I am currently leaving, and I accedently merged the drive code with the testing code, so there might be something wrong.
 I commented out all of the drive code in RobotContainer, but i dont know if there is other code from drive stuff
 that needs to be removed.
